Our AI model is designed to assist doctors in determining if a tumor is benign (not dangerous) or malignant (cancerous). It examines medical information to provide predictions, supporting doctors in making better decisions for their patients. Our goal in communicating these results is to ensure that the information is clear, useful, and accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise
